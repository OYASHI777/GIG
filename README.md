A project to create randomized imperfect information extensive form games

## Description  
Generalist AI Agents trained over a variety of games can outperform specialist AI Agents 
([Deepmind SIMA](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/)).  
This is an experimental idea to create randomized imperfect information extensive form games for the purpose of training a generalist AI Agent.
